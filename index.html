		People of all ages can learn to enjoy this sport, and it does not always have to be so expensive in order to play. A great thing about golf
		is also that you can practice by yourself or with other people. This is a game of concentration, so it could be good to do both. People do not think
		that you can get much exercise, but people tend to walk over 4 miles per 18 hole round! It is more tiring then most people expect.

<p id=people>People will hit different distances depending on their strength level and experience with the game.
	Don't let this chart fool you into thinking that these are the distances you will hit. 
	With enough practice, and enough effort, you should be able to hit just as far, if not farther than the distances shown. 
	There are also many factors to take into consideration when striking the ball. Ball type, swing speed, weather, and club utilization are
	all different components that will make you hit farther or shorter.
	It is also not always about distance. As long as you are hitting the ball straight, these distances could still give you the scores you need to play well. 
	This sport requires much dedication and practice, but the effort does pay off when you see your shot soar.
	These distances are averages, but they are not concrete. Do not be discouraged, and keep on trying to play your best!</p>

	<p id=though>Though the game may be frustrating at times, practice is the only way for you to get the results that you need. 
	Go the driving range and putting greens frequently in order to hone in on your skills throughout your game. Also, make sure to breathe and swing smoothly. 
	Do not jerk the club, and swing in a constant motion. It is important not to underestimate yourself, but also to not try and swing as hard as possible on every shot.
	Golf is more about consitency than distance. It is very important to give yourself years to progress in golf, because this sport does not happen over-night.
	If you can have the discipline and patience to keep trying, you should be able to become a very skilled golfer. Also, remember to have fun while playing. This should not be a sport
	that makes you scream in frustration.</p>
